I am a Ph.D at MIT in Transportation supervised by Prof.Jinhua Zhao and Prof.Gioele Zardini. I am affliated with the Urban mobility Lab (JTL) and the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS). My research focuses on the design and operation control of Autonmous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) service, as well as its interaction with the existing infrastructures. 

Prior to MIT, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Traffic Engineering from Tongji University in China, and my master's degree in Mobility and Data Science from EPFL, Lausanne in Switzerland. During my masters' year, I had the honor to exchange in the Machine Learning for Smart Mobility (MLSM) lab at DTU in Denmark, under the supervision of Prof.Filipe Rodrigues.
